# Privacy Policy for RackRush & RackRush Kids

**Last Updated:** January 14, 2026

## Introduction
Use of RackRush and RackRush Kids (the "Apps") is subject to this Privacy Policy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a safe experience for all users, especially children.

## Data Collection
We collect only the minimum data needed to operate core features.

- The Apps function primarily offline.
- We do not require email/password account registration.
- We do not sell personal data.
- We do not use third-party advertising or tracking SDKs.

### RackRush Kids (Standalone) and Kids Mode
- No behavioral advertising or tracking.
- Online features are disabled by default.
- If a parent enables online play, the app may transmit a device-scoped identifier to support anonymous matchmaking.

### RackRush (Main App)
- If you use online multiplayer and Game Center features, gameplay information (such as match results/scores) may be processed to support matchmaking and leaderboards.
- The app may collect basic product interaction and crash/diagnostic information to improve stability and performance.

## Kids Privacy (COPPA Compliance)
RackRush Kids and the Kids Mode feature in RackRush are designed to be safe for children.
- **No Tracking:** We do not use tracking or behavioral advertising.
- **Minimal Data (Online Play):** If a parent enables online play, the app may transmit a device-scoped identifier for anonymous matchmaking.
- **Offline First:** Core gameplay works offline. Word meanings are available offline for a bundled set of kid-friendly definitions, and can optionally be fetched online for other words when enabled.
- **No Ads:** There are no third-party advertisements in the Kids Mode/App.
- **External Links:** There are no links to external websites or social media within the Kids interface.

## Third-Party Services
The Apps may make limited use of the following third-party services for specific non-personal functionality:
- **Dictionary APIs:** The app may fetch word meanings from public dictionary services. Requests include only the word being looked up plus standard network metadata (e.g. IP address) required to complete the request. We do not store this information.
- **Apple Game Center:** If you choose to use Game Center features (leaderboards/achievements), you are subject to Apple's Privacy Policy. We do not store your Game Center data on our servers.
